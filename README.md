Classic Snake Game Development in C and C++

I am developing a classic Snake game using both C and C++ programming languages. In C, I focus on writing clean and efficient code without relying on low-level programming techniques, ensuring the game is easy to understand and maintain. Using C++, I incorporate object-oriented programming principles to enhance the game's design and functionality. The game features smooth snake movement, real-time collision detection, dynamic growth mechanics, and increasingly challenging levels. By implementing the game in both languages, I showcase my versatility and understanding of different programming paradigms. This project allows me to strengthen my coding skills and gain valuable experience in game development.
